    <p>
        In this study, you will be asked to complete four different games.
         None of these will take more than 5 minutes.
         In addition to your participation payment of {{participation_fee}}, we will randomly select one of the four games and pay you based on your performance in that game.
         Once you have completed all four games, the computer will randomly determine which game counts for payment. The method we use to determine your earnings varies across games. Before each game we will describe in detail how your payment is determined.
