    <p>
      At the beginning of each Decision Problem, you are going to be given a choice between two courses of action: <br>
      1. See {{Constants.num_options}} options, each with {{Constants.num_attributes}} characters (i.e. #'s and %'s) and earn points by choosing from those options <br>
      2. Take an <b>outside option</b> that earns you {{Constants.nbo_value}} points and skip seeing any displayed options
    </p>
    <p>
      This <b>outside option</b> has no display and earns you {{Constants.nbo_value}} points if you choose it.
      Choosing the <b>outside option</b> effectively means that you are skipping making any choices in the Decision Problem, opting to take {{Constants.nbo_value}} points instead of earning them by selecting a displayed option.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be given this choice in <b>every</b> Decision Problem. So if you decide to take the <b>outside option</b> in one Decision Problem, you can still choose to see your displayed options in a later Decision Problem.
