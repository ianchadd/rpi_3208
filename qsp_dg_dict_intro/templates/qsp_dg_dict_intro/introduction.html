    <p>Welcome!
      Here is a brief overview of the study.</p>

    <h5><u>What will I have to do?</u></h5>

        <p>    This study consists of <strong>three</strong> tasks which will be explained in detail later.
        The study should take no longer than <strong>20</strong> minutes in total.
        </p>
    <h5>  <u>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</u>
    </h5>
        <p>    You will be paid 1 USD for completing the study.
        </p>
        <p>    Additionally, you may receive <strong>additional bonus payments</strong> based on your decisions in Tasks 1 or 2.
          At the end of the study, we will randomly pick <strong>either</strong> Task 1 <strong>or</strong> Task 2 to determine your bonus payment.
          Since nobody knows which task will be selected for payment, you should pay close attention to the tasks as your decisions may determine your earnings.
        </p>
    <h5>    <u>How will payment be made?</u>
    </h5>
        <p>During the study, we will be trading in experimental currency units (ECU).
          At the end of the study, any ECU you have received from the tasks will be converted to USD using the following conversion rate: <strong>20 ECU = 1 USD</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This experiment will continue over the next 21 days.
          Once all participants complete this study, we will determine your bonus payments based on the decisions made in the tasks and pay these to you via the Prolific platform.
        </p>

<h5> <u>Please note!</u>
</h5>

<p>    There will be several <strong>Attention Check</strong> questions throughout this study meant to test whether you are paying attention.
  If you fail to correctly complete any of these Attention Check questions, you may not be paid.
</p>

<p>    Finally, please note that in line with standard economics experiments, your bonus payments will be determined in the manner as described in the instructions.
</p>
