    <p>
        Thank you for completing Game 1 - Piece Rate!
    </p>

  <br>

  <!--  <h5>Overview:</h5>   -->

    <p>
        In <strong>Game 2 - Tournament</strong>, you will again be given {{time_limit}} seconds to participate in the Counting Task.
        <!--  However, for this game, your payment depends on your performance <strong>relative to that of a group of 3 other participants</strong>.  --> </p>

      <p>
        If Game 2 is randomly chosen for payment, you will be paid <strong>{{round_values}}</strong> per each box solved <u>only if</u> your performance is the <strong>highest</strong> in your group of four.
        Otherwise you will not receive any payments in Game 2. In case of ties, the winner will be randomly determined among the top performers.
            </p>
  <p>
         We refer to this as the <strong>tournament payment</strong> since your payment depends on your performance <strong>relative to that of 3 other participants</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your group members are <strong>three other participants</strong> in the United States, also recruited via the Prolific Platform.
        Your group will stay the same for the remainder of this study.
    </p>
  <!--     <h5>Tournament Prize:</h5>

    <p>

        <p>
        If you are the winner of this tournament, the amount that you will receive per solved box will be randomly chosen from the following amounts: <strong>{{round_values}}.</strong>
         </p>

  <p>
    Each of these tournament prizes are equally likely to be chosen. Right now, nobody knows which prize will be chosen.

          Previously, a group of subjects on Prolific, like yourself, participated in this study.
          We coded the number of boxes they solved in each game into this program.
          In order to construct your group of four, we will randomly select three of these past participants.
          Your performance will not affect the payoffs of your group members.
          {% else %}
          In order to construct your group of four, we will randomly select three other participants and use their answers in determination of your earnings for Game 2 - Tournament.
          This group will be constructed <strong>after</strong> all participants have made their decisions in the current study.
          For this reason, you will only be informed of your performance in the tournament if Game 2 - Tournament is chosen for payment <strong>after</strong> the current study is over and when you are paid your bonus payment.

                If Game 2 - Tournament is the one randomly selected for payment, then your earnings depend on the number of boxes you completed compared to the other three people in your group.
                If you complete more boxes than the other three people in your group, you will be paid some amount per completed box.
                Otherwise, you will not be paid anything for Game 2 - Tournament.
                The amount paid per completed box will be randomly determined at the end of the experiment from the following amounts: {{round_values}}.
                Each of these prizes has an equal chance of being chosen. If there are ties, the winner will be randomly determined among the group members who tied for first place.
