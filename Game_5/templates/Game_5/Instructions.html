    Game 5 â€“ Investment Decision
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <p>
        In Game-5, you are endowed with 50 points and asked to choose the portion of this amount (between 0 and 50 points, inclusive) that you wish to invest in a tournament for each potential tournament prize. The rest of the 50 points will be invested in a <strong>piece rate payment</strong> scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
        The payments for each point invested in the options are as follows:
    </p>

    <ol type="A">
        <li>The piece rate scheme pays 1 cent per point for each completed box</li>
        <li>The tournament scheme pays 5 cents per point for each completed box if you complete more boxes than the other three group members.  Otherwise, you will be paid zero for this part of the experiment</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We now ask you to choose how many of the 50 points you would like to invest in option A (the piece rate) and how many in option B (the tournament). Please remember that the two numbers should add up to 50 points.
    </p>

        I would like to invest <input id="Points_A_Box" name="Points_A" type="number" min="0" max="50" class="form-control points-box text-center"></input> points in Option A (the piece rate) and <input id="Points_B_Box" name="Points_B" type="number" class="form-control points-box text-center"></input> points in Option B (the tournament).
