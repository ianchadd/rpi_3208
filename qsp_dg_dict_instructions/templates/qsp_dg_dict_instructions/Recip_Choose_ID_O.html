<p> The person with whom you will be matched chose a personal ID that is a combination of (i) an 8-digit alpha-numeric string of characters and (ii) an icon.
</p>

<p> They first chose the 8-digit alpha-numeric string of characters and were shown the screen displayed below:
</p>
<img src="{% static img%}" alt="ID Choice" style="border: 5px solid #555;">

<p> Every participant who has chosen a personal ID was shown the exact same options for the 8-digit alpha-numeric string as displayed above, but the order of the list of options was randomized.
