        You will be given {{time_limit}} seconds to complete as many boxes as possible.
        If Game 1 - Piece Rate is randomly selected for payment, then you get {{piece_rate}} cents per each box you completed successfully in the {{time_limit}} seconds.
        We refer to this payment as the <strong>piece rate payment</strong>, since you will be paid for each completed box.
