    <p>
        For Game 1, you will be asked to complete The Counting Tasks. To remind you, in The Counting Tasks, you will see series of boxes containing 49 ones and zeros each as presented below. Your task is to determine the number of zeros in the box. As soon as you submit an answer for the box, another box will appear.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will be given {{time_limit}} seconds to complete as many boxes as possible.
        If Game 1 is randomly selected for payment, then you get {{piece_rate}} cents per each box you completed successfully in the {{time_limit}} seconds.
        Your payment does not decrease if you select an incorrect pair.
        We only count the boxes that you complete successfully.
        We refer to this payment as the <strong>piece rate payment</strong>, since you will be paid for each completed box.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are now ready to start Game-1. Remember, you will have {{time_limit}} seconds to complete this game.
