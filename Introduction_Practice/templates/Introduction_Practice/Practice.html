    <p>
    Above, you see a box containing 49 ones and zeros.
    Your task is to determine the number of zeros in the box.
    Once youâ€™ve determined the number of zeros in the box, enter that number in the field above and click Submit.
    </p>
    <p>
    On this screen <strong>only</strong>, you will see a pop-up that tells you whether your answer was correct.
    When you actually do the Counting Task for payment later in this experiment, <strong>you will not see this pop-up</strong>.
    You will, however, see the number of correct submissions you have made in the top left corner of the screen when you are participating in Counting Task for payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: you will do this a total of three times to practice and learn how these boxes works.
