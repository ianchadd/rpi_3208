# Making edits to the repo
When making edits to the repo:
- create new branch and label it with the current date
- add informative messages to each commit
- err on the side of creatinga a commit for each small functional change/ bug fix (I should be able to know what happened in the commit with a one sentence message)
- push commits to the newly created branch
- issue a pull request with Ian Chadd as the reviewer
- I will reviewer and merge to master periodically
